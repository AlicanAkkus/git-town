        The Big Picture
      </h1>

      <h4>The problem: Software development doesn’t scale well</h4>

      <p>Every software team runs into typical scalability issues:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>More team members means more frequent commits to the main development branch.
        This means feature branches will fall behind the main branch more often,
        which results in bigger, uglier merge conflicts when
        finally getting the <a href="http://www.lgtm.in">LGTM</a> and merging these feature branches
        into the main development branch.</li>
        <li>These merge conflicts increase the
        likelihood of breaking the main development branch, which brings
        the productivity of the whole team down.</li>
        <li>Old branches accumulate, making it harder to maintain an overview of
        where current development is happening, and where unmerged changes are.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>These are only a few of the many headaches that diminish developer productivity and
      happiness as a development team grows.
      These issues are almost completely independent of the particular development workflow and how/where the code is hosted.</p>

      <h2>The approach: Developer discipline</h2>

      <p>Fortunately, most of these issues can be addressed with (a lot) more discipline:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>Always update your local repo before cutting a new feature branch.</li>
      <li>Synchronize all your feature branches several times per day with
      ongoing development from the rest of the team. This keeps merge conflicts small and easily
      resolvable.</li>
      <li>Before merging a finished feature branch into the main development branch,
      update the main development branch and merge it into your feature
      branch.
      Doing so allows you to resolve and test any merge conflicts on the feature branch,
      and keeps the main branch green.</li>
      <li>Always remove all Git branches once you are done with them, from
      both your local machine as well as the shared team repository.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2>The solution: A tool that goes the extra mile for you</h2>

      <p>It is difficult to follow these practices consistently, because Git is an intentionally
      generic and low-level tool,
      designed to support many different ways of using it equally well.
      Git is a really wonderful <em>foundation</em> for robust and flexible
      source code management, but it does not provide direct high-level support for collaborative software development workflows.
      Using this low-level tool for
      high-level development workflows will therefore always be cumbersome and inefficient.
      For example:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>creating a new, up-to-date feature branch in the middle of active
      development requires
      <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town/blob/d52802cd211f40e4966b598acc584c2abe326645/features/git-hack/on_feature_branch/with_remote_origin/with_open_changes.feature#L22-L27">up to 6 individual Git commands</a>.</li>
      <li>updating a feature branch with the latest changes on the main
      branch requires
      <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town/blob/d52802cd211f40e4966b598acc584c2abe326645/features/git-sync/current_branch/feature_branch/no_conflict/with_tracking_branch.feature#L24-L33">up to 10 Git commands</a>,
      even if there are no merge conflicts</li>
      <li>properly merging a finished feature branch into the main development branch after
      getting the LGTM in the middle of working on something else
      requires up to
      <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town/blob/d52802cd211f40e4966b598acc584c2abe326645/features/git-ship/supplied_branch/feature_branch/with_tracking_branch.feature#L19-L33">15 Git commands</a>.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Keeping
      <a href="http://blog.originate.com/blog/2015/02/13/refactoring-git-branches-part-ii">feature branches small and focused</a>
      means more feature branches.
      Running all these commands on each feature branch every day easily leads to each developer
      having to run hundreds of Git commands each day!</p>

      <p>While there are a number of tools like <a href="https://github.com/nvie/gitflow">Git Flow</a>
      that focus on supporting a particular Git branching model,
      there is currently no natural extension of the Git philosophy
      towards generic, robust, high-level teamwork support.</p>

      <p>We are pumped to release exactly that today:
      <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town">Git Town</a>!
      It provides a number of additional high-level Git commands.
      Each command implements a typical step in most common team-based software development workflows.
      Designed to be a natural extension to Git, Git Town feels like Git,
      and supports many different ways of using it equally well.
      The <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town/blob/master/documentation/tutorial.md">tutorial</a>
      explains these commands and how to use them.</p>

      <h2>The awesomeness: Made for everybody, as Open Source</h2>

      <p>Git Town is made for beginners and experts alike.
      If you are new to Git, and just want it to stay out of your way
      and manage your code, let Git Town provide the expertise and do the legwork for you.
      If, on the other hand, you are a Git ninja, and want to
      use it in the most effective manner possible,
      let Git Town automate
      the repetitive parts of what you would type over and
      over,
      with no impact on your conventions and workflow.</p>

      <p>Git Town is open source, runs everywhere Git runs (it’s written in Bash),
      is <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town#configuration">configurable</a>,
      robust, well <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town#documentation">documented</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/Originate/git-town/tree/master/features">well tested</a>,
      has proven itself on everything from small open source projects to large enterprise code bases here at Originate,
      and has an active and friendly developer community.</p>
